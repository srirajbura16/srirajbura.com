## About

I’m a self-taught full-stack developer from Toronto, Canada. I graduated from HS last year and initially planned on taking a year off. Through being active in coding communities, I came to the conclusion of pursuing learning on my own to become a developer. I may not be able to work on software that goes into airplanes or rockets with my experience(yet!), but sure can work on the web!

## What I'm Doing Now

Implementing MVP features on a full-stack app called [Marketplace](https://github.com/srirajbura16/Marketplace) where users can sell things.

- [x] Authentication
- [ ] Image upload
- [ ] User chat using socket.io

Revamping my resume and portfolio

## What I’m currently learning

- Web Securtiy
- TypeScript
- DS and Algorithms
