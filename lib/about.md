## About
I'm a full-stack developer from Toronto, Canada. I recently graduated from HS and initially planned on taking a year off, but through being active in coding communities, I concluded on pursuing learning on my own to become a software developer. Throughout my journey, I came to learn a lot about full-stack development and what I want to do in the future.

As a soon-to-be rookie starting out in the industry, I'm looking forward to working and learning alongside a company to reach its goals!
## What I'm Doing Now

Implementing MVP features on a full-stack app called [Marketplace](https://github.com/srirajbura16/Marketplace) where users can sell things.
