## About

I'm a full-stack developer from Toronto, Canada. I recently graduated from HS and initially planned on taking a year off, but through being active in coding communities, I concluded on pursuing learning on my own to become a software developer. Throughout my journey, I came to learn a lot about full-stack development and what I want to do in the future.

As a soon-to-be rookie starting out in the industry, I'm looking forward to working and learning alongside a company to reach its goals!

## What Iâ€™m currently learning

- DS and Algorithms
